# Intro

This script serves as a reference for the project workflow, the functions used, and other useful functions contained within the *drake* and *mlr* packages that were not used in the other scripts. 

# Repo Intro

The main purpose of this repo is to provide an example for the usefulness of the *drake* and *mlr* packages in creating interpretable, repeatable, and modular data science pipelines within R. Within it, a raw, real-world dataset is imported, processed, modeled, and benchmarked to show the primary capabiltiies of both *drake* and *mlr*.
